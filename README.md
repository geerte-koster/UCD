# USER-CENTERED DESIGN (UCD) 
UCD OF A CURRICULUM MAPPING VISUALISATION TOOL & AN ONLINE MINI-GAME TO IMPROVE DATA LITERACY IN ADULTS



To create the figures and do the analyses as presented in this thesis, different datasets and python scripts are used. To create the figures in Figure 4 and Suppl. Figure 1, the curriculum maps of the 28 courses in the Professional Psychology program were used as input data (for an example see Figure 3). To create Figure 7 and 8, the evaluation scores of the 105 students and their categorised answers to the open questions are used.
